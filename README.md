# CPE3300 Embedded Project
This project implements a NIC for a network protocol specified by the professor for this class. The network protocol isn't used anywhere in the real world; its specifications were assembled to be the basis of a project for a class. The specifications are in `CPE3300-project-std-2024.pdf`.

We implemented this project on an STM32 Nucleo dev board, using [Embassy](https://github.com/embassy-rs/embassy) for its embedded async features. As this project was worked on during a very busy term, our code isn't the cleanest, but it taught us a lot about writing embedded Rust.
